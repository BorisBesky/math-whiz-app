   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/math-whiz-app.git
   cd math-whiz-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   Create a `.env` file with your configuration:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   ```

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Deployment

The app is configured for Netlify deployment with serverless functions:

```bash
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod
```

## 🏗 Architecture

### Adaptive Learning System
The app features a sophisticated complexity engine that:
- Analyzes student response patterns across time and accuracy
- Uses Welford's algorithm for statistical analysis
- Implements progressive difficulty scaling
- Maintains topic-specific performance history

### Data Structure
```javascript
// User progress is organized by grade and topic
{
  selectedGrade: "G3" | "G4",
  dailyGoalsByGrade: {
    G3: { [topic]: goalCount },
    G4: { [topic]: goalCount }
  },
  progressByGrade: {
    [date]: {
      G3: { [topic]: completedCount },
      G4: { [topic]: completedCount }
    }
  },
  answeredQuestions: [{
    topic: string,
    grade: "G3" | "G4",
    correct: boolean,
    timeSpent: number,
    complexity: number,
    timestamp: Date
  }]
}
```

### Content Management
- Modular topic structure in `/src/content/`
- Grade-specific question generators
- Reusable explanation components
- Mathematical rendering with KaTeX

## 📈 Performance Features

- **Intelligent Caching**: Optimized question generation and content loading
- **Progressive Web App**: Offline-capable with service worker support
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with touch-friendly interactions
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant with keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### How to Set an Admin User

To use the new admin functionality, you must designate a user as an admin. This is done by setting a "custom claim" on their Firebase account.

1.  **Create an Admin User in Firebase:**
    *   Go to your [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Navigate to **Authentication** -> **Users** tab.
    *   Click **Add user** and create a user with an email and password. This will be your admin login.

2.  **Set Environment Variables Locally:**
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project if you don't already have one.
    *   Add your Firebase Admin SDK credentials to this file. You can get these from your Firebase project settings (Service Accounts -> Generate new private key).
    
        ```.env
        FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
        FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL="firebase-adminsdk-...@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
        FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
        ```
    *   **IMPORTANT:** The `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` must be enclosed in quotes and have `\n` at the end of each line, as shown.

3.  **Run the `set-admin.js` Script:**
    *   Open your terminal in the project root.
    *   Run the script, passing the email of the user you just created as an argument:
    
        ```bash
        node set-admin.js your-admin-email@example.com
        ```

    *   The script will confirm that the user has been granted admin privileges. The user will have these privileges the next time they sign in.
