# Role-Based Authentication System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive role-based authentication system with three distinct user types and corresponding access controls.

## User Types and Access Permissions

### 1. Students
- **Login Methods**: Anonymous (guest) or email/password
- **Access**: 
  - ✅ Main math app functionality (`/` and `/app`)
  - ❌ Cannot access teacher portal (`/teacher`)
  - ❌ Cannot access admin portal (`/admin`)
- **Features**: Practice math problems, earn coins, view progress

### 2. Teachers
- **Login Methods**: Email/password or SSO (when configured)
- **Access**: 
  - ✅ Main math app functionality (`/` and `/app`)
  - ✅ Teacher portal (`/teacher`) - exclusive access
  - ❌ Cannot access admin portal (`/admin`)
- **Features**: All student features plus class management, student roster, assignments

### 3. Administrators
- **Login Methods**: Email/password or SSO (when configured)
- **Access**: 
  - ✅ Main math app functionality (`/` and `/app`)
  - ✅ Teacher portal (`/teacher`)
  - ✅ Admin portal (`/admin`) - exclusive access
- **Features**: All teacher features plus system administration, user management

## Implementation Details

### New Components Created
1. **`AuthContext.js`** - Centralized authentication state management
2. **`ProtectedRoute.js`** - Route-level access control based on user roles
3. **`StudentLogin.js`** - Student authentication interface
4. **`TeacherLogin.js`** - Teacher authentication interface (updated)
5. **`AdminLogin.js`** - Administrator authentication interface (updated)
6. **`userRoles.js`** - Role constants and utility functions

### Updated Components
1. **`App.js`** - New routing with protected routes and authentication providers
2. **`MainApp.js`** - Enhanced header with user info and role-based navigation
3. **`TeacherDashboard.js`** - Integrated with new auth system
4. **`AdminPage.js`** - Simplified using new auth context

### Database Structure
- User profiles stored under `/artifacts/default-app-id/users/{userId}`
- Classes stored under `/artifacts/default-app-id/classes/{classId}`
- Role information embedded in user profiles

### Authentication Routes
- `/student-login` - Student authentication
- `/teacher-login` - Teacher authentication  
- `/admin-login` - Administrator authentication

### Protected Routes
- `/app` - Main application (all authenticated users)
- `/teacher` - Teacher dashboard (teachers and admins only)
- `/admin` - Admin portal (admins only)

## Key Features

### Role-Based Access Control
- Automatic role detection from Firestore user profiles
- Route protection based on user roles
- Dynamic UI elements based on permissions
- Secure logout functionality

### User Experience
- Seamless authentication flow
- Role-specific navigation in header
- User information display with role badges
- Cross-role navigation links where appropriate

### Security
- Role validation on both frontend and backend (via Firestore rules)
- Protected routes prevent unauthorized access
- Anonymous users can only access student functionality
- Email/password authentication for privileged roles

## Technical Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. User selects appropriate login page
2. Credentials validated via Firebase Auth
3. User role retrieved from Firestore profile
4. Role-based redirect to appropriate interface
5. Protected routes enforce access controls

### State Management
- React Context API for global auth state
- Firebase Auth integration
- Firestore for user profile and role storage
- Persistent login sessions

## Testing Status
✅ Build compiles successfully
✅ No TypeScript/JavaScript errors
✅ Role-based routing implemented
✅ Authentication components functional
✅ Database paths corrected to use `/artifacts/default-app-id/` structure

## Next Steps
1. Configure SSO providers (Google, Microsoft, etc.)
2. Implement email verification for new accounts
3. Add password reset functionality
4. Create admin interface for user role management
5. Add audit logging for authentication events
