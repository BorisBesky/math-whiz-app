Write a plan for changing data model for teachers. Instead of keeping a separate Teachers collection, use the users collection and 
under teacher's profile subcollections, add classes which stores array of classids.

Step 1: Custom Claim (No Change)
Create Cloud Function to set the custom claim on the teacher's Auth account. This identifies them as a "teacher" in the system, giving them the privilege to perform this kind of check.

JavaScript

// This claim simply confirms: "This user IS a teacher."
await admin.auth().setCustomUserClaims(userUid, { role: "teacher" });


Step 2: Your New Firestore Data Model
Based on your description, your database structure would look like this:

A classes collection:

Document: class_101_math

subject: "Algebra II"

room: "B-21"

assignedTeacherId: "teacher_bob_uid_123" // <-- Bob teaches this class

Document: class_202_history

subject: "World History"

room: "C-05"

assignedTeacherId: "teacher_alice_uid_456" // <-- Alice teaches this class

A students collection:

Document: student_jane_doe

name: "Jane Doe"

classId: "class_101_math" // <-- Jane is in Bob's class

Document: student_john_smith

name: "John Smith"

classId: "class_101_math" // <-- John is also in Bob's class

Document: student_alex_jones

name: "Alex Jones"

classId: "class_202_history" // <-- Alex is in Alice's class

Step 3: Modified Firestore Security Rule
Now, when a teacher tries to read a student document, your rule must:

Check if the user is a teacher (using the claim).

Get the classId from the student record.

Fetch the corresponding document from the classes collection.

Check if the user's UID matches the assignedTeacherId on that class document.

This is all done with the built-in get() function.

JavaScript

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // You don't need to secure the 'classes' collection as much for reads,
    // as it likely just contains public metadata. Writes should be locked.
    match /classes/{classId} {
      allow read: if true; // Or 'if request.auth != null'
      allow write: if false; // Only admins or functions should create classes
    }

    // This is the key rule for your student records
    match /studentRecords/{studentId} {
    
      allow read, write: if
          // Condition 1: Is the user a teacher?
          request.auth.token.role == 'teacher'
          
          && // AND
          
          // Condition 2: Does their UID match the teacherId on the 
          // class document that this student belongs to?
          request.auth.uid == get(
             /databases/$(database)/documents/classes/$(resource.data.classId)
          ).data.assignedTeacherId;
    }
  }
}
How This Rule Works:
When "Teacher Bob" (UID teacher_bob_uid_123) tries to read student_jane_doe:

Firebase checks: request.auth.token.role == 'teacher'. This is true.

Firebase looks at the student document's data (resource.data) and finds its classId is "class_101_math".

The get() function fetches the document at /classes/class_101_math.

It reads the data from that class: .data.assignedTeacherId, which is "teacher_bob_uid_123".

It compares that value to the requesting user's ID: "teacher_bob_uid_123" == "teacher_bob_uid_123". This is true.

Since both conditions are true, access is GRANTED.

If "Teacher Alice" tried to read the same record, step 5 would fail ("teacher_alice_uid_456" == "teacher_bob_uid_123"), and access would be DENIED.
